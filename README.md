# react-cli
An attempt at creating a basic and tailored react cli to boost productivity. 
Using Rust + Clap v4.

## Disclaimer
This tool is tailored for my needs. Source files are accessible and easily customozable to suit to your needs.

Don't hesitate to change files structure, routing system, installation, etc... (in commands, not in project of course)
You can also add commands I wouldn't have thought of.
